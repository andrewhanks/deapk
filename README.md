Who am I?
=====

I am a dreamer in pursuit of simplest way, loving technology and advocating combination of humanities, technology and art. Just like all of you, I also have been doing my endeavors on the long way chasing our dream.

Perhaps you are also this kind of man who can not wait to change anything that has been found unreasonable and not perfect because you feel so miserable for this. We have to live in such an imperfect world, but we have the ability to change everything.

Believe me, provision of the simplest and best service is just the first step in the long march. Although it is not great, it still has profound significance. In the near future, you will see more of my works, all of which will be arising from my interests.

Please follow me and thanks for your consistent supports.

Now I am working in the largest Internet security company in China - Qihoo 360, as Android software engineer.
